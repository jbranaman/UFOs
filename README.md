# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
A webpage has been created for Dana to analyze UFO data from a dataset using a search tool to display the data in a table. Dana would like a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. She would like table filters added for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The website introduces itself as a place to examine the existence of UFOs where one is allowed to dig through data provided to determine their own conclusions.

To perform a search, all that is necessary is to enter pieces of information to filter through the data such as date, location (city, state & country), and the shape type of the UFO. Changes to the search fields are detected and filtered based on the information provided. The fields are case sensitive as all lowercase.

Below is an image of the search fields without data provided.

## Summary
### Drawback of New Design
The major drawback of this new design is that all information entered has to properly align with the data so if the user does not know what is in the whole dataset then it will be challenging to narrow it down.
### Recommendations
One recommendation would be create the search tool to have dropdown options so the user can see what options are available and select instead of having to guess or scroll through all the data.

A second recommendation would be, if continuing with text fields versus a dropdown selection, to create a function that would correct for case sensitivity and additional spaces or symbols.
